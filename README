This is a commandline utility to list the routes in your asp.net mvc application
Call it with the path to your appliation dll and it will list your routes

For the default routes in asp.net MVC you get the following output:
{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo} httpMethods:
{controller}/{action}/{id} httpMethods:

httpMethods would be filled in if you add it to your route or decorate your action with (AccecptVerbs, HttpPost, HttpGet etc)

It can help you get an overview of your routes while developing, since you get all the routes listed.
Furthermore if you have a route to a controller not existing, MvcRoute will notify you.
